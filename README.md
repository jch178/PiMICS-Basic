# PiMICS-Basic
The model was made using Blender, a free, open source 3D modeling and animation package.  It takes a while to learn, but there are many excellent tutorials online.  Blender is good option for most 3D modeling. Fusion 360 or Tinkercad are also good options.   

The STL file was made assuming inches.  Import the STL in imperial units. Slice the file in whatever software you prefer and then print it.  For Prusa,use PrusaSlicer, a free app downloadable from Prusa.  Slice it and print it.  

The code assumes that the user has a basic knowledge of Python programming.  If not, we highly recommend taking some free online tutorial courses in Python.  The Python program assumes that the user has used the same GPIO pins.  If not, please change the code appropriately.  We have tried to comment the code to make it somewhat easy to follow.
